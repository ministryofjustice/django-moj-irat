Django settings:

.. code-block:: python

    HEALTHCHECKS = [
        'moj_irat.healthchecks.database_healthcheck',

To work on changes to this library, itâ€™s recommended to install it in editable mode into a virtual environment,
i.e. ``pip install --editable .``

Use ``python -m tests`` to run all tests locally.
Alternatively, you can use ``tox`` if you have multiple python versions.

[Only for GitHub team members] Distribute a new version to `PyPI`_ by:

- updating the ``VERSION`` tuple in ``moj_irat/__init__.py``
- adding a note to the `History`_
- publishing a release on GitHub which triggers an upload to PyPI;
  alternatively, run ``python -m build; twine upload dist/*`` locally
